          I am a graphic designer and illustrator originally from China, now living in Berlin. Most of my work focuses on branding, print and illustration. I graduated from the Chinese Academy of Art with a Bachlor’s degree, and then pursued further studies at the University of Art (Universität der Künste) Berlin.

          I have 10 years of experience in design, communication and project management in the creative sector. I worked for a diverse range of clients such as Porsche, a major Belgian food brand, several startups and international Chinese corporations. In addition, I pursue several personal design projects, like designing a handbag line or illustrating Children’s books.
